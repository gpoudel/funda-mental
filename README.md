Analyzing real estate data from funda.nl



## PART I - Making the data ready (Extract, Transform & Save)
---------------------------------------------------------------
I stumbled upon open data api of funda and thought it might be intresting to do a very small project. I did not stated this with anything particular in mind other than just playing with data. 

You can also check the open api links [here](https://content.funda.nl/opdrachten/cmd-amsterdam/maart-2017) (if the link still works). If the link does not work or you are not intrested in this extract and transform part, you can find a data file in csv format in /data/ folder as 'fundaDB.csv'.
